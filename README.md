This Java program that implements a single linked list to manage COVID-vaccine applicants, storing their SID, first name, last name, and previous vaccines received. The program follows the assignment instructions by inserting 10 applicants with randomly generated names and vaccine histories. It then randomly deletes two applicants, displays the remaining list, deletes all applicants, and confirms that the list is empty. The implementation includes essential linked list operations such as insert, delete, deleteAll, traverse, getSize, and isEmpty.
